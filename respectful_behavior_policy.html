                    <h1>ANS Respectful Behavior Policy (Abbreviated)</h1>
                    <p>The open exchange of ideas, freedom of thought and expression, and productive scientific debate are central to the mission of the American Nuclear Society (ANS). These require an open and diverse environment that is built on dignity and mutual respect for all participants and ANS staff members, and is free of bias and intimidation.</p>


<p>ANS is dedicated to providing a safe, welcoming, and productive experience for everyone participating in Society events and other Society activities regardless of age, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, marital status, military service status, national origin, parental status, physical appearance, race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation. Creation of a safe and welcoming environment is a shared responsibility held by all participants.  Therefore, ANS will not tolerate harassment of or by participants (including ANS volunteer leaders and staff members) in any form.  Disciplinary action for participants found to have violated this principle may include reprimand, expulsion from an event or activity with or without a refund, temporary or permanent exclusion from all ANS events and activities, suspension or expulsion from volunteer leadership positions or groups, and/or suspension or expulsion from Society membership, as appropriate.</p>


<p>If you or someone else experiences harassment, regardless of how you otherwise choose to initially handle the situation, you are encouraged to report the situation to ANS.  It is possible that the behavior you experienced is part of a larger pattern of repeated harassment.  Please alert ANS to behavior you feel to be harassment regardless of the offender’s identity or standing in the Society.</p>
